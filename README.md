Security is undoubtedly one of the foremost concerns with cloud infrastructure. While AWS makes sure itâ€™s upholding cloud security through best practices and a wide range of security resources, one still need to observe and follow the right security practices when deploying and maintaining AWS workloads.   

This AWS Security Series is designed to bring awareness around different AWS Services from a security mindset focusing on risks and compliance. 

**Session 1 :sparkles: [AWS Security Fundamentals and Audit Best Practices](https://youtu.be/I_snxnOF_3w) (Date: June 19th, 2021)**: This session marks the beginning of our AWS Security series and aims at going through the fundamental knowledge around cloud security and auditing. Have you ever wondered how exposed your AWS account is, or what all AWS resources are accessible to everyone over the Internet ? If not, then this session can help you out to be aware about your AWS account resources. One can learn how to audit their own AWS accounts with the help of industry standard tools. Presentation [here](https://github.com/ntnshrm87/AWS-Security-Series/blob/main/Session-1/AWS%20Security%20Fundamentals.pdf).

**Session 2 :sparkles: [Introduction to AWS Identity & Access Management with Security Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfyGLgpq-E) (Date: July 3rd, 2021)**: AWS IAM is a free service offered by AWS which provides secure access control mechanisms for all of your AWS services and resources. It is at the heart of AWS Security because it empowers the AWS account owners to control access by creating users and groups, assigning specific permissions and policies, setting up MFA and so on. In this session, we will demystify the fundamentals of AWS IAM with a security mindset while understanding about different related terminologies. At the end, there will be a few hands-on exercises about using IAM Access Analyzer. Presentation [here](https://github.com/ntnshrm87/AWS-Security-Series/blob/main/Session-2.1/AWS%20Security%20Series_%20Session%202.pdf).

**Session 3 :sparkles: [AWS Identity & Access Management: Attack and Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbUDP8DHNrM) (Date: July 17th, 2021)**: This will be in continuation of the previous IAM session and covers the security best practices and recommendations for AWS IAM service along with a hands-on demo utilizing an IAM Security Assessment tool. This session is dedicated to folks who would like to understand AWS IAM related misconfigurations and exploitations.

**Session 4 :sparkles: [AWS S3 Security: Fundamentals of Data Protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkdVy77Ym1U) (Date: Aug 14th, 2021)**: AWS launched their Storage service under the name S3 aka Simple Storage Service in the year 2006. Since then, there have been a lot of advancements in S3 technology. However, due to apparent inability of organisations to correctly and appropriately secure the data they hold in AWS Cloud S3 Buckets, data gets exfiltrated and breached. This session will cover the fundamental aspects for Data Protection and securing S3 configuration.

**Session 5 :sparkles: [AWS S3 Security: Attack & Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTw2-ZwrOQk) (Date: Sept. 4th, 2021)**: This will be in continuation of the previous S3 session and covers the security best practices and recommendations for AWS S3 service along with a hands-on demo utilizing an S3 Security Assessment tool. This session is dedicated to folks who would like to understand AWS S3 related misconfigurations and exploitations.

**Session 6 :sparkles: [AWS Security: Logging & Monitoring Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foCykBtq_Fo) (Date: Sept. 18th, 2021)**: Logging and monitoring are both valuable components in maintaining optimal application performance as well as security incident response. Using a combination of logging tools and real-time monitoring systems helps improve observability and reduces the time spent sifting through log files to determine the root cause of performance problems. In AWS workloads, this is managed with the help of two prominent services viz. CloudTrail and CloudWatch. In this session, we are going to cover up the basics around these services, how to configure and then analyse the log outcomes.Presentation [here](https://github.com/ntnshrm87/AWS-Security-Series/blob/main/Session-6/AWS%20Security%20Series_%20Session%206.pdf)

**Session 7 :sparkles: [AWS Security: Data Classification and Protection with AWS Macie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuJTqR0hqY) (Date: Oct. 9th, 2021)**: As organizations manage growing volumes of data, identifying and protecting their sensitive data at scale can become increasingly complex, expensive, and time-consuming. In cloud workloads, this become more difficult to a certain extent. To help customers manage the scalable on-demand and automated sensitive data discovery  jobs within AWS workloads, Amazon Macie comes to rescue. Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS. In this session, we are going to discuss about Amazon Macie service to assess data privacy, security and regulatory compliance for AWS workloads.
